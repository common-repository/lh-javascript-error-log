== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Javascript Error log, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-javascript-error-log/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-javascript-error-log/) . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.

= What if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?  =
